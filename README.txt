This project contains all basic amenities that can be done by a bank. We can create an account, Withdraw money, deposit money, change the details of your account,
delete your account, transfer money from your account to another account, view your account details, view all the account holders details, passbook entry,
apply for loan, retrieve your password. We can create savings account or current account or fixed deposit account. We give adults an interest of 9% per year
and senior citizen of 12% per year. The entire account holders list can be viewed only by a bank official who knows the bank password. The passbook will 
contain the details of what all actions you have taken regarding your account. Loan can be applied and the interest for the adults is 12% per year and 9% for 
senior citizens. The due date should be paid monthly. 

The details of those who forgot to pay the due money will be viewed by the bank officials. If you forget your password it can be retrieved by knowing the
keyword you have given while creating your account.

This reduces the human effort and really very easy to use

This program works in DEV-C++ version 5.8.3.
